# Intelligent and Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles

Part of my final year project studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (w/ Year In Industry) at Royal Holloway University of London.

## Structure

Each functional behaviour is implemented as a micro-service and communicates via a publisher-subscriber model implemented by ROS ([Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/)).

## Report

The report contains code snippets for interesting and relevant aspects of the system.

## Video

The video is a run of the final system showing off both modes of operation (details in the report).

At the time I did not have a working understanding of linux processes hence the number of terminals opened to each microservice individually.

## Code

Student Gerald did not organise his work well so I'm looking for the code.
I'll re-record the video to better manage the processes when I've found it!
